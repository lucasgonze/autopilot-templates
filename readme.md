SMS Listserv
============

A user-friendly alternative to SMS-based chat groups, based on Twilio Autopilot

An SMS-based chat groups is ordinarily created by having one person send a text to a set of recipients, rather than just one. Some times these groups take on a life of their own rather than disappearing. For example, I am one of 13 people in a group for my son's soccer team.

This project will use the Twilio API to improve on text groups:

1. A participant will be able to remove themself from the thread. Ordinarily that is impossible after the thread starts.
2. A participant will be able to add themself to the thread. Ordinarily that is impossible once the thread has gotten started.
3. A participant will be able to set their name and other metadata, like email address. Ordinarily every participant needs to have every other participant in their address book in order to see their name, and participants have no way to find names for numbers not in their address book.
4. A sender will only have to send to a single number, not to a collection.
5. A recipient will receive from a single number, and will be able to block or filter that number. Ordinarily chats come from a combination of all the numbers and are nearly impossible to filter.

This code is work in progress. It is not yet working.
